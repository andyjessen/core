 *  \brief Regular Base SAS Macros
 *  \details These macros have the following attributes:

        * OS independent
        * Not metadata aware
        * No X command
        * Prefixes:  _mf_, _mp_

    Macros starting `mf_` are macro _functions_ and can be used in assignment
    statements.  Those starting `mp_` are macro _procedures_, which generate
    SAS statements, and must therefore be applied accordingly.

    to insert the package into the CMPLIB option.
