# Security Policy

Security is an extremely high priority when it comes to the SASjs product suite.  We take a number of steps across all repositories to minimise risk, such as:

* Regular dependabot updates
* Snyk reports
* Minimising dependencies, especially production dependencies (sasjs/core has NONE)
* Testing & Code review process

## Supported Versions

We support only the latest version

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We welcome disclosures of all kinds in relation to all the SASjs libraries.  You can submit them here: [https://sasapps.io/contact-us](https://sasapps.io/contact-us)
